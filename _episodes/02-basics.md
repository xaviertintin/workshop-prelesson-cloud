title: "Getting started with Argo and Kubectl"
teaching: 10
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How to use Kubectl commands?"
- "What is kubectl?"
- "What is Argo workflows?"

objectives:
- "Lear what the kubectl command can do"
- "Appreciate the necessity for the Argo workflows tool (or similar)"
- "Lear how to set up different services/resources to get the most of your cluster"

keypoints:
- "`kubectl` is the ruler of GKE"
- "Argo is a very useful tool for running workflows and parallel jobs"
- "To be able to write, read and extract data, a few services/resources need to be set up on the GCP"

## The `kubectl` command
Kubernetes provides a kubectl for communicating with a Kubernetes cluster's control plane, using the Kubernetes API.
Use the following syntax to run kubectl commands from your terminal window:

```bash
kubectl [command] [TYPE] [NAME] [flags]
```

where ```command ```, ```TYPE```, ```NAME```, and ```flags``` are:

```command:``` Specifies the operation that you want to perform on one or more resources, for example create, get, describe, delete.
<br />```TYPE:``` Specifies the resource type.
<br />```NAME:``` Specifies the name of the resource. 
<br /> ```flags:```Specifies optional flags. 
<br />
<br />For installation instructions, see [Installing kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kubectl); for a quick guide:

* See the [cheat sheet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/).
* The `kubectl` command is the main tool for interacting with your K8s cluster. You will use it to do essentially anything in the cluster. [Here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/) is the official *cheatsheet*, which is very useful but already very long.

Let's run a few examples.

* Get the status of the nodes in your cluster:

```bash
kubectl get nodes  
```

* Get the cluster info:

```bash
kubectl cluster-info  # Display addresses of the master and services
```

Let's list some kubernetes components:

* Check pods

```bash
kubectl get pod
```

* Check the services

```bash
kubectl get services
```

We don't have much going on.  Let's create some components.

* Inspect the `create` operation

```bash
kubectl create -h
```

Note there is no `pod` on the list, so in K8s you don't create pods but *deployments*.  These will create pods, which will run under the hood.

* Let's create an application, it does not matter which.  Let's go for `nginx`:

```bash
kubectl create deployment mynginx-depl --image=nginx
```

The `nginx` image will be pulled down from the Docker Hub.
This is the most minimalist way of creating a deployment.

* Check the deployments

```bash
kubectl get deployment
```

* Check pods

```bash
kubectl get pod
```

## Argo

Argo is a collection of open source tools that let us to extend the functions in Kubernetes. We can find some benefits from use argo.
- Cloud agnostic service
- Argo can execute on absolutely in all clusters in kubernetes.
- We can review the state of resources constantly.
- There is a large capacity of executing jobs at the same time and from different nodes.
- It’s possible correct debug errors.
We are going to explain 3 of the tools most important for working with argo.

### Argo as a workflow engine

- Is used to execute complex job orchestration, including serial and parallel execution where each stage is executed like a container.
- It is the most popular workflow execution engine for kubernetes.
- You can run thousands of workflows a day, each with thousands of concurrent tasks.
- Designed from the ground up for containers without the overhead and limitations of legacy VM and server-based environments. 

While jobs can also be run manually, a workflow engine makes defining and
submitting jobs easier. In this tutorial, we use
[argo](https://argoproj.github.io/argo/quick-start/).
Install it into your working environment with the following commands
(all commands to be entered into the cloud shell):

While jobs can also be run manually, a workflow engine makes defining and submitting jobs easier. In this tutorial, we use [argo quick start](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/quick-start/) page to install it.

## Namespaces

Namespaces are a kind of reservations in your K8s cluster.  Let's create one for the Argo workflow we will user

```bash
kubectl create ns <NAMESPACE>
```

> ## Kubernetes namespaces
>
> The above commands as well as most of the following use a flag `-n argo`,
> which defines the namespace in which the resources are queried or created.
> [Namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
> separate resources in the cluster, effectively giving you multiple virtual
> clusters within a cluster.
>
> You can change the default namespace to `argo` as follows:
>
> ```bash
> kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=argo
> ```
